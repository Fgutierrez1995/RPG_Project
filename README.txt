Character Creation: Allow the player to create a character with a name, class (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue), and initial attributes (e.g., health, attack power, defense).

World Exploration: Create a fictional world with multiple locations (e.g., towns, forests, dungeons). The player should be able to move between locations and interact with NPCs (non-player characters) in each location.

Battle System: Implement a turn-based battle system where the player can encounter enemies and engage in battles. Each character (both player and enemies) should have health, attack power, defense, and other attributes that affect the outcome of battles.

Leveling and Progression: Allow the player's character to gain experience points (XP) and level up after defeating enemies. Leveling up should increase the character's attributes and grant access to new abilities or skills.

Inventory Management: Provide the player with an inventory system where they can collect items (e.g., potions, weapons, armor) during their adventures. The player should be able to equip and use items during battles.

Game Over and Victory: Implement a game over condition when the player's character runs out of health points. Also, provide a victory condition when the player completes specific quests or defeats a final boss.
